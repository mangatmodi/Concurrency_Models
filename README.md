# Preface: 

The software development has changed a lot in last 10 years, where the big focus is on performance and advent of multicore cpus, has supported the need/advent of concurrent programs. This blog series is an attempt to understand and to benchmark various concurrency models prevelant in the industry. I have used Java as my primary language, but some of the concurrency models are not natively present in Java, so I had to use different language someplaces.

There is a blog series written over these tests, which can be found here - https://medium.com/@mangatmodi
